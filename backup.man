is a script that allows for easy backup creation. It allows entering directories in various ways: selecting a directory from a list, 
entering a path, or using a graphical file selection dialog. It features options for periodic backups and settings storage.
.P
Upon running the script, the main menu is displayed, where the user can choose one of the five options. 
These include different methods of entering paths, as well as an option to display the currently selected directories and proceed to create a backup. 
After confirming the settings, the user chooses whether the backup should be saved as a directory or a .tar.gz archive.

After saving, the user has the option to enable periodic backups for the just-created backup. 
This option is an entry in the crontab file that calls an additional script

option, providing the configuration file for the newly created backup.

Upon execution, the user can load options from a file. In this case, the added directories are visible along with the other selected directories. Saving settings is possible after creating a backup.
